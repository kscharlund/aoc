# Advent of Code solutions #

These are my solutions to the problems from
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) from 2020 onwards.

Some problems or solutions I found noteworthy for whatever reason:

## 2020-12-08 ##

Took me a while to get that I should just test all modified programs. Don't
think that the backtracking solution I implemented is necessary, probably
just evaluating would have worked as well.

## 2020-12-10 ##

Cool problem. I got to the straightforward solution based on 1- or 3-diffs by
calculating the number of combinations for different runs by hand. The dynamic
programming and recursive solutions are nice, but made inspired by other code.

## 2020-12-13 ##

A Chinese Remainder Theorem application. Since I could recall the term, I just
found a solver in SymPy instead of actually trying to solve the problem myself.
Later, I implemented a handwritten solution inspired by some code from reddit.
I think I could have gotten there myself if I hadn't remembered the CRT...

## 2020-12-14 ##

Got stumped by part 2 after trying to run the small example input from part 1
on a brute force solution. Had to go to reddit to get unstuck, the brute force
solution works for all input in the big input set.

## 2020-12-15 ##

Brute force, used the exact same solution for parts 1 and 2. Wonder if there is
a nicer way?

## 2020-12-17 ##

A variation on the problem from 2020-12-11 (Game of Life-like simulation),
but the solution I found for this problem was much nicer.
Also extremely easy to adapt from part 1 to part 2.

A simple expression parsing problem, I solved part 1 using a hand-written
recursive parser. For part two, where operator precedence was introduced,
I found Dijkstras
[shunting-yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm)
that I hadn't heard about before and found very pleasing. More reading on the
expression parsing topic here: http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/03/31.html.

Some pretty interesting Python trickery to be able to use `eval` on
https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kfh5gn/2020_day_18_part2_swapping_to_parse_using_the/.

## 2020-12-19 ##

This one was tough for me. I managed to solve part 1 with an ugly, inefficient
recursive solution. For part 2, I nicked code from
[reddit user thomasahle](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/kg1mro/2020_day_19_solutions/ggcohaa)
instead. Just not inspired enough to do it properly...

Another nice solution, similar to what I was going for but done competently:

## 2020-12-20 ##

Another tough one, I don't know if I'll be able to keep it going until
Christmas Day. Decided on a backtracking solution quickly, but had a hard
time getting the recursion right. Once that was done, the rest was OK. Some
duplication between part 1 and 2, but not too bad.

## 2020-12-23 ##

Ouch. The correct data representation just never occurred to me. Managed to
implement a crappy version of part 1 manipulating an index dict, but was too
ashamed to commit that to the git history. Using a linked list is obvious in
retrospect, but I had to go to reddit to get a hint. :(

## 2021-12-14 ##

The first one in 2021 where I had to look on reddit for hints. Probably not so
much to do with the problem, more a question of being tired.

## 2022-12-12 ##

Could use my code Dijkstra + bucket queue code from 2021-12-15 pretty much
straight up. Had to adjust graph representation slightly and handle non-zero
source position, but otherwise no problems. Thought about Floyd-Warshall,
but O(N^3) time is too much. :(

Then, later in the evening, I realized that the shortest path in an unweighted
graph is just a BFS. Doh.

## 2022-12-16 ##

Tough! Had to browse around a bit for hints to overcome my mental block on part
one. I thought about generating permutations, but couldn't figure out how to
prune the search space until I read about someone
(https://www.reddit.com/user/Ill_Swimming4942/) that had the same idea and used
the time limit to reduce the number of candidates.

Part two was also hard, but got a pretty pleasing solution in the end. Runs in
over two minutes, though.

## 2022-12-19 ##

Incredibly messy and ad-hoc. Close to giving up the entire season. A well-placed
hint from Henrik and some questionable code to reduce memory usage finally
cracked part two.

## 2022-12-21 ##

Part one straightforward, took me quite a while to figure out the right
approach for part two. Was trying more symbolic approaches first.

## 2022-12-25 ##

Pretty simple but still nice. [Emil's](https://github.com/estyrke) solution
was so much better than mine that I updated my code afterwards to look like his.

## 2023-12-18 ##

Wrote lots of hacky and messy code until a colleague mentioned the [shoelace
formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula). Hadn't heard of it
before, very nice.
